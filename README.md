# DGL113 Course Project
1. This is the initial DGL113 project repository readme file. When you view this file, it means you have accepted the project and cloned the initial repository. There is no starting file other than this readme for the project. You will create your own files based on your proposal and design, add them to the docs/ folder, then push your work back to GitHub.
1. Write your project proposal directly in this file in the section below. At a minimum, you should describe what a website you are going to work on and the 3 features that you plan to implement. See the project description on Brightspace for more details.
1. <b>This part of the project is due Mon. Feb. 26 at 11:59pm.</b>
## Project Proposal
### Website
The website I've chosen for this project is the website we're redesigning for Outback Nursery in DGL 309. We haven't yet coded the website in HTML/CSS (we should be coding it soon) but I've designed the [homepage layout](https://xd.adobe.com/view/18869fa2-2cd0-4fcf-a29f-7e451ee4329a-4dd5/) in Adobe XD.

### Javascript Interactions / Special Effects
1. Add fade-ins and slide-ins to text and images
2. Create a carousel for the testimonials' section
3. Create an effect in banner sections (at top of website and just under hero section) so that text moves horizontally across screen in a continuous loop
